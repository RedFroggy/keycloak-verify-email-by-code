#### Templates

You can override individual templates in your own theme. To create a custom email message for the mytheme theme copy
themes/base/email/email-verification-with-code.ftl (in keycloak theme) to themes/mytheme/email/

To create a custom email verify form for the mytheme theme copy template
[login-verify-email-code.ftl](src/main/resources/theme-resources/templates/login-verify-email-code.ftl) to
themes/mytheme/login

#### Code length and symbols

Verify email code is generated using `org.keycloak.common.util.RandomString`. By default generated code will be 8 characters long and will use alphanumeric symbols. You may customize this behavior using SPI configuration in your `standalone.xml` file:

- property `code-length` is a numeric value representing the number of symbols, defaults to `8`
- property `code-symbols` is a string value listing all accepted symbols, defaults to `RandomString.alphanum`

e.g. configure action to generate a code of 6 digits :

```shell
bin/kc.[sh|bat] start --spi-required-action-VERIFY_EMAIL_CODE-code-length=6 --spi-required-action-VERIFY_EMAIL_CODE-code-symbols=0123456789 
```
